 2022 Lunch & Learn workshop - Resume & CV development

Within this repository you will find information relating to strategically developing résumés and cirriculum vitae (CVs) tailored for the industry and employment opportunity you are seeking. When you add this repository to your GitHub you will see five folders: Activities, DDPSC Job Adverts, Example Biosketches, CVs, and Résumés, Example Cover Letters, and Helpful Documents. 

Folders:
-Activties: Helpful activities to get you thinking from the perspective of the employer and applicant
*NOTE* Some of these activities require groups but can easily be performed on your own. Use the job opportunities in the DDPSC Job Adverts folder to assist you or use the job opportunity you are looking to apply for.
